How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    To see what has been changed in the code and the difference in the results,
so that we can know whether the changes cause any problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    To see what mistakes I have taken in the process and avoid them in the future.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Users have more control.
	Cons: Users have to manually do all commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because files using Git are likely to be connected to each others, while files
like Google Docs are independent.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "Git log" gives the list of recent commits.
	"Git diff" compare the differences between two specific commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I will be more confident making changes because I can always reverse back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Version Control?
